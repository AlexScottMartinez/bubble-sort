# bubble-sort

## Asignment

   - Build a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using `#sort` would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

```rb
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```

## How to run code
Within the directory, insert `ruby bubble_sort.rb` in the command terminal. The result should be printed out on the terminal.
